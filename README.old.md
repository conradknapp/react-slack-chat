- Install dependencies (mention issues with Node 10)
- Init project - npx create-react-app
- Clean up - remove logo, sw, markup, add component folder
- Install react-router-dom / firebase
- Set up routes (Register, Login, App/Chat)
- Set up basic markup in Register / Login components and hook to index.js (make sure you can navigate bet. pages)
- Add firebase config (in index.js)

- Add semantic-ui-react and semantic-ui-css; [Cover ability to create custom styles for semantic ui or change color attr]
- Add import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css' and remove index.css
- Go to layouts for login form
- Create more inputs for signing up (in Login), add names to form, create state and registerUser function and log 'register' on form submit
- Hook up one way data binding to state (with handleChange) look to see that state value are updated with React DevTools
- Pass values back down to inputs with value attr
- Import firebase from index.js file to use firebase.auth() to register a user; [make note about using console.dir to make sure that the firebase object that you export contains an auth function within services]
- Create isFormValid function to check form upon calling the registerUser function, add errors property to state object
- Write the two associated functions--isFormEmpty and isPasswordValid and link them with isFormValid
- Clear errors when user is successfully registered; talk about adding .trim() to the end of event.target.value in handleChange
- Conditionally show errors as part of a message component; [{!!errors.length && this.displayErrors()}]
- Add 'error' to class names of certain inputs according to whether there was an error [i.e. className={!this.state.passwordsValid ? "error" : null}] // [also make note of the fact that when form has the attribute error, it will show all error messages]
  -- Show how you can push an object onto the errors array in state which contains a message and an error type [{ message: 'alskjdf', type: 'password' }]; this gives you can convenient way to create a ternary to change the classname of an input according to whether there is a certain error (with errors.some(conditionFunc))

- Also show that firebase returns to us validations errors; add those errors to the error object
- When you add messages to the error object, show the benefit of using push over concat (since concat returns the entire array whereas push will just return its new length)
